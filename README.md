# LightGeometry 🌌

**LightGeometry** is a sleek web project that combines **dynamic geometric shapes** with **pulsating, blurred light effects**, creating a captivating, immersive visual experience. The project runs entirely in the browser using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **no external dependencies**.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Polygons**: Generates polygons with 3–8 sides that float upward and fade out naturally.
* **Vibrant Colors**: Each shape comes with randomly selected, glowing colors and subtle shadows.
* **Blurred Light Effects**: Soft red and blue light circles appear randomly, adding depth and atmosphere.
* **Full-Screen Canvas**: Shapes and lights cover the entire viewport.
* **Frosted Glass Blur**: Background blur filter for a polished, cinematic look.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully adapts to any modern browser and screen size.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Watch polygons and light effects animate smoothly across the screen.
3. Optional console controls for advanced users:

```javascript
// Spawn a shape manually
window._lelga.spawn();

// Stop spawning new shapes
window._lelga.stop();

// Resume spawning shapes
window._lelga.start();
```

## 🎨 Customization

Adjust these parameters directly in the script:

* **Shape properties**: number of sides, size, speed, color palette.
* **Light effects**: number of lights, colors, size, fade speed.
* **Spawn rate**: interval for new polygon creation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering shapes and lights.
* **CSS3**: Full-screen layout and blur filter.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: Animation, randomness, and interactivity.
